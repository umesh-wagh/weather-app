## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The weather application is made for every kind of user. It provides simplicity, reliability and good interface to the end user.
The technologies are used in this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are some key concepts in the project like API, API key, etc. JSON is used to read the data from the server and then fetch method is implemented in a project to access the various API parameters. I took almost 20 - 25 hrs to complete this project. Skill-Lync helped me that how to apply the JavaScript programming features in building a web application. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
> User must have installed the visual studio code on the Desktop.
> User must have installed the Live Server Extension to go for live server in the VS code.
> User must have an account created on a website i.e. https://www.openweathermap.org// to get the access to an API and API key.
> CPU: Intel i5 or higher (U series or higher) recommended
> Memory: 8 GB
> Free storage: 4 GB
> Screen resolution: 1280 x 800
> User must have a reliable internet connection to run the application. In case if internet connection is not reliable then prefer different device internet connection.
> Visual Studio code can be install from the below website:
> https://code.visualstudio.com//
> Installation is very simple follow each and every instruction while an installing the VS code.

### Installing VS code
One can get the installation guide from the official website of VS code i.e. https://code.visualstudio.com//.

## üîß Test cases for an application <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.
1]Application must work under given facilities.
> Check for internet connection if it available and reliable.
> Check for the API accuracy if it must be accurate.
> Check for the API key provided by the website it must an accurate.
> Check for the Valid location throughout the world.
> Check for the each and every API parameters.

### Break down into end to end tests
Above given tests cases helps to cover all the important modules of an application.

```
In case if there is no internet connection then app will not load API data.
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Application interface is quite user friendly that any common user will let know that how to use the application because there application structure is made in such a way that user just has to enter the city name and by pressing the Enter button user will get the weather API data of that location.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
